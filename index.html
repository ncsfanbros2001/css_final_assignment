            After taking over her great blacksmithing teacher's forge, she felt a lack of excitement in her life.
            So, she decided to be free and depart on a journey to find rare smithing materials, one of which was rumored
            to be under the building of a certain "idol group" in town.
            She also loves challenging herself and has a peculiar taste when it comes to foods!
